# Used Technologies

## 1. React-router-dom

- Install react-router to navigate between pages -> "npm install react-router-dom"
- I use React Router DOM for managing page navigation and components. It employs the "path" property to specify which component to display or route to when certain conditions or URLs are met. This "path" property is essential for navigating to the desired pages or components within your application.

## 2. React-bootstrap

- Install react-bootstrap to style the components -> npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap"
- I utilize React Bootstrap primarily for styling my application's components. Bootstrap is among the technologies that excel in providing styling capabilities. It offers user-friendly features, making it a favored tool for developers to enhance their application's interface.

#### \* This is the two technologies that I used in the web application.
